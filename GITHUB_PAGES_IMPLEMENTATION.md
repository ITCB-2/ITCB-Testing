# üé≠ GitHub Pages Setup Complete!

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

I've successfully set up automated GitHub Pages hosting for your Playwright HTML reports. Here's what's now configured:

### üìÅ Files Created/Modified

1. **NEW: `.github/workflows/deploy-reports.yml`**
   - Automatically deploys reports to GitHub Pages after CI workflows complete
   - Creates a beautiful landing page for browsing reports
   - Handles multiple report types (Sanity, Regression, Code Quality)
   - Maintains historical archive of reports

2. **MODIFIED: `.github/workflows/sanity.yml`**
   - Enhanced with deployment summary messages
   - Maintains existing functionality while linking to reports

3. **MODIFIED: `.github/workflows/nightly-regression.yml`**
   - Enhanced with deployment summary messages
   - Maintains existing functionality while linking to reports

4. **MODIFIED: `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`**
   - Maintained as development-focused quality gate
   - Focuses on linting, formatting, and TypeScript compilation
   - Does not generate HTML reports (development tool only)

5. **NEW: `docs/GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md`**
   - Complete documentation for the GitHub Pages setup
   - Troubleshooting guide and configuration details

6. **NEW: `scripts/test-pages-deployment.sh`**
   - Local testing script to verify report structure
   - Helpful for testing before deployment

7. **UPDATED: `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`**
   - Added GitHub Pages documentation to the index

## üöÄ Required Setup Steps

To enable this functionality, you need to:

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (REQUIRED)

```
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/ITCB-2/ITCB-Testing
2. Click Settings ‚Üí Pages (in the left sidebar)
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. Click Save
```

### 2. Verify Permissions (Should be automatic)

The workflows already have the necessary permissions configured:

- `contents: read`
- `pages: write`
- `id-token: write`
- `actions: read`

## üìä What Happens Next

Once GitHub Pages is enabled:

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Reports will be deployed after test workflows complete
2. **Report Access**: Available at `https://itcb-2.github.io/ITCB-Testing/`
3. **Report Views**:
   - Landing page with test reports for stakeholders
   - Latest reports at `/latest/`
   - Historical archive at `/archives/`
   - Latest reports at `/latest/`
   - Historical archive at `/archives/`

## üéØ Report Types Generated

| **Workflow**       | **When**          | **Report Name**                        | **Content**                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Sanity Tests       | Every 30 minutes  | `sanity-playwright-report`             | @sanity tagged tests           |
| Nightly Regression | Daily at 2 AM UTC | `nightly-regression-playwright-report` | All tests                      |
| Code Quality Check | On push/PR        | _No HTML reports_                      | Development quality gates only |

## üß™ Test the Setup

You can test the report structure locally:

```bash
./scripts/test-pages-deployment.sh
```

This will create a local version of what gets deployed to GitHub Pages.

## üì± Accessing Reports

Once deployed (after enabling GitHub Pages):

- **Main Page**: https://itcb-2.github.io/ITCB-Testing/
- **Latest Report**: https://itcb-2.github.io/ITCB-Testing/latest/
- **Archives**: https://itcb-2.github.io/ITCB-Testing/archives/

## üîß Manual Report Deployment

You can also manually deploy specific reports:

1. Go to Actions ‚Üí "Deploy Playwright Reports to GitHub Pages"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the source test workflow (sanity or regression)
4. Click "Run workflow"

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** (the only required manual step)
2. **Run a test workflow** to generate your first report
3. **Check the deployment** at your GitHub Pages URL
4. **Share the reports** with your team!

The first deployment may take a few minutes after enabling GitHub Pages, but subsequent deployments will be faster.
