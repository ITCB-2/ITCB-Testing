# Testing Progress Report

I have mostly completed testing the links in the top menu, except for 5-6 tests that are not passing:

1. Two tests are related to bot protection
2. One test involves mobile phone verification and receiving a password via phone (I'm not sure how to handle this)
3. Two tests are failing because they can't locate elements on the respective pages

Apart from these cases, all other tests are passing successfully. For the failing tests, I have implemented most of the test logic up to the validation part.

## Outstanding Issues:
- Bot protection handling (2 tests)
- Mobile phone verification flow
- Element location issues in specific pages (2 tests)

## Next Steps:
- Investigate alternative approaches for bot protection tests
- Research mobile phone verification testing strategies
- Debug element location issues
