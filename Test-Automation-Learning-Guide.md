# Test Automation Learning Guide for Beginners

This guide is designed for beginner automation engineers, using the ITCB-Testing project as a reference. It covers key concepts, subjects, and a suggested learning structure to help you get started with test automation in a real-world context.

## 1. Introduction to Test Automation

- **What is Test Automation?**
- **Benefits of Automation**
- **Manual vs. Automated Testing**
- **Common Tools & Frameworks**

## 2. Project Overview: ITCB-Testing

- **Project Structure**: Understanding folders like `src/`, `tests/`, `playwright.config.ts`, etc.
- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Playwright, Node.js
- **Test Types**: End-to-end (E2E), UI, Integration

## 3. Core Automation Concepts

- **Locators & Selectors**: How to find elements on a page
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Organizing code for maintainability
- **Test Fixtures**: Setting up and tearing down test environments
- **Assertions**: Validating expected outcomes

## 4. Writing Your First Automated Test

- **Setting Up the Environment**: Installing dependencies, configuring Playwright
- **Basic Test Example**: Navigating to a page, interacting with elements, making assertions
- **Running Tests**: Using npm scripts and Playwright CLI

## 5. Advanced Topics

- **Test Data Management**: Using fixtures and data files
- **Handling Dynamic Content**: Waiting for elements, retry strategies
- **Parallel Test Execution**: Speeding up test runs
- **Reporting & Debugging**: Using Playwright reports, analyzing failures

## 6. Best Practices

- **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, and code reviews
- **Test Organization**: Naming conventions, folder structure
- **CI/CD Integration**: Running tests automatically on pull requests
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and how to resolve them

## 7. Learning Path & Resources

- **Step-by-Step Roadmap**:
  1. Learn JavaScript/TypeScript basics
  2. Understand web technologies (HTML, CSS, DOM)
  3. Study Playwright fundamentals
  4. Explore the ITCB-Testing project structure
  5. Write and run your own tests
  6. Review and refactor tests for maintainability
- **Recommended Reading**:
  - [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/)
  - [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
  - [ITCB-Testing Project Docs](./docs/)

## 8. Example Project Structure (ITCB-Testing)

```
src/
  core/         # Base classes and utilities
  data/         # Test data and URLs
  fixtures/     # Test setup and teardown
  helpers/      # Utility functions
  locators/     # Element locators
  pages/        # Page objects
  tests/        # Test cases
```

## 9. Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Set up your development environment
- [ ] Explore the project structure
- [ ] Run existing tests
- [ ] Write your first test
- [ ] Review test results and reports
